AXI Contextual Input Overlay Keyboard definition for TheNohT's NohBoard application.

## Welcome

This project is a keyboard for the NohBoard application developed by TheNohT <https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/releases>

The defined keyboard hotkeys can be reassigned using NohBoard's built in editor; however, this keyboard has several overlapping key elements:
Throttle 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 
Roll Clockwise, Roll Counter-Clockwise, AND
Yaw Left/Right, Pitch Up/Down

Alternative to editing keybind hotkeys in the Nohboard edit mode, a keybinds.json and windows batch file is provided in the AHK directory. Also, editing the "KeyCodes" key values in .\Maneuvering\keyboard.json will also work. Keybinds are Unicode decimal numbers.
